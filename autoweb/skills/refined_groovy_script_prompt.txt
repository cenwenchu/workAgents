You previously generated Groovy Playwright automation code for the following task.
Original User Task:
%s

Cleaned HTML snapshot of the current page/frame:
%s

Previous Groovy Code:
%s

Execution Output / Error Log:
%s

Additional User Hint For Fixing The Code:
%s

CRITICAL FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- If an element is reported as missing, FIRST verify its existence and visibility in the provided HTML.
- DO NOT guess selectors or framework prefixes (ant-, art-, el-) if the element is not present in the HTML.
- Check for hidden elements (bounding box width/height > 0) before using selectors.
Your goal is to FIX and IMPROVE the Groovy code based on the execution result and the new hint.
Requirements:
- Preserve the overall intent of the original task and code.
- Use the HTML structure above to ground all selectors.
- Apply the same GLOBAL PRINCIPLES as before: avoid guessing framework prefixes, prefer tbody tr for standard tables, use locator('...').first() in strict mode, and do not use page.waitForLoadState("networkidle").
- Avoid redefining variables with the same name in the same scope.
- Output ONLY the final Groovy code, no explanations.
